# Pet-Project: Weather App

That is a simple SPA where I tried to work 
with an external weather API and make some 
basic manipulations with the api responses.

API requests are made through useWeather custom hook.

That is also a first project of mine to use tailwind CSS.

Besides the whether search, projects features loader
and simple string error catcher to add make better user
experience
