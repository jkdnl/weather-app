# Pet-Project: Weather App

That is a simple SPA where I tried to work 
with an external weather API and make some 
basic manipulations with the api responses.

API requests are made through useWeather custom hook.

That is also a first project of mine to use tailwind CSS.

Besides the weather search, projects features loader
and simple string error catcher to make better user
experience.

Authentication and logout is made through Firebase,
forms are made with Formik and yup.
